Business Problem Report: Aircraft Risk Assessment

## Overview
Our company is expanding its portfolio by investing in the aviation industry. Management is considering purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private companies. Aviation, however, is a highly regulated, capital-intensive industry with paramount safety concerns.
To minimize financial and operational risk, we must identify the safest aircraft types by examining historical accident and incident data. This report summarizes key findings to guide purchasing decisions strategically.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholders

Head of Aviation Division – responsible for deciding which aircraft to purchase.

Executive Management – monitors profitability, risk exposure, and diversification success.

Operations Team – ensures compliance, maintenance, and safe operations.

### Key Business Questions

Which aircraft types historically have the lowest accident rates?

Are certain aircraft models or manufacturers consistently safer than others?

What factors (e.g., aircraft age, engine type, usage) influence risk?

Based on safety and operational history, which aircraft are the most viable for entry into the market?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data

Aviation_Data.csv: Accident/incident reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), containing detailed information on aircraft, accident causes, and outcomes.

### Description of Data
Key fields include:

Accident.Number – unique ID for each accident.

Event.Date – date of occurrence.

Location – geographical region.

Aircraft.Category – Commercial, General Aviation.

Make and Model – manufacturer and aircraft type.

Injury.Severity – Fatal, Serious, Minor, or None.

Total.Fatal.Injuries – fatalities per accident.

Data-set covers tens of thousands of accidents across multiple decades, providing a robust basis for risk analysis.

## Visualizations
  1: Accident frequency by aircraft manufacturer
  
Bar chart comparing manufacturers (Cessna, Boeing, Airbus, Piper, etc.).
Helps identify which manufacturers are associated with more incidents.

  2: Distribution of accidents by severity
  
Pie chart or stacked bar chart (Fatal, Serious, Minor, None).
Helps measure how severe accidents are across different aircraft categories.

  3: Trend of accidents over time
  
Line chart of accidents per year.
Reveals whether aviation safety is improving or worsening over time.

## Conclusion
Summary of Findings

Certain manufacturers/models reliably have lower accident severity (e.g., newer Boeing and Airbus jets in commercial flight have fewer fatal crashes than older, smaller general aviation planes).

The majority of accidents occur in general aviation planes (e.g., small Piper, Cessna), which suggests more risk for private enterprise flights than commercial fleets.

Accident severity has been trending downwards, which means that newer models and new technology are safer investments overall.

## Recommendations

Focus on early growth into newer commercial aircraft (Boeing, Airbus, Embraer) with pristine safety records.

Avoid high-risk, older general aviation aircraft unless targeting private markets with strict risk management.

Invest in full-maintenance programs and pilot training to further reduce operational risk.
